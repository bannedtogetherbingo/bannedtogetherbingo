Welcome to BTB
--------------

We are a collaborative fandom group concerned with censorship and interested in
ongoing instruction and support of proper tagging. We believe tags empower readers
and writers alike by allowing them to retain the power of making choices for
themselves instead of having choices be made for them.

Complete and proper tagging is not easy!

It is often an ongoing process made more complicated by inconsistant use across
different fandoms and sub-groups within fandom. We can only try our best.
